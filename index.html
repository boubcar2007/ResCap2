    <h3> From Beginner to Website Wizard:</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine, five years ago, I was like a lost traveler in a strange land called coding. I had no idea how those lines of symbols and letters turned into websites that we see every day. 
      It felt like magic that I couldn't understand. But now, after five years of learning and practice, I'm proud to say that I can create websites myself! <br>
      At the start, coding felt like a secret code that I couldn't crack. The words and rules were confusing, and I often got frustrated when things didn't work. 
      But instead of giving up, I decided to dive in and learn step by step. I used online lessons and tools that helped me understand how to build websites.
      I began with the basics: think of it like building a simple sandcastle on the beach. I learned how to use HTML and CSS, which are like the building blocks. 
      Slowly, I started making web pages that looked nice and organized.
      As time went on, I got more confident. It was like leveling up in a video game. 
      I learned JavaScript, which is like adding special powers to your sandcastle – it makes things move and interact.
       I also discovered frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, which are like toolkits that make building websites faster and easier.
       <br>Now, when I look back, I can't believe how far I've come. I've gone from being confused by coding to being able to make websites that people can use. I can create buttons that work, 
       forms that collect information, and even make things change when you click on them.
      It's not just about the technical stuff; it's also about being creative.<br> Every website I make is like a mini project where I get to solve puzzles and make things look cool.
      This journey has been a rollercoaster. There were times when I got stuck and felt like giving up, but I kept going. And guess what? It paid off! Now, I'm part of a community of people who love coding.
       We help each other out, share ideas, and create amazing things together.
      Looking ahead, I'm excited to keep learning and growing. Who knows what cool websites I'll make in the next five years? The best part is that I've learned that anyone can learn to code – you just need to be curious, patient, and willing to try new things.</p>

    <h3> Working-out</h3>
    <div class="img-gym"> <img class="gym" src="./images/gym.jpg"> </div>
    <p>Every morning, the sun peeks over the horizon, and I'm already lacing up my sneakers. The rhythm of my heartbeat matches the beat of my favorite workout playlist.
       Sweating and pushing limits, each lift and step feels like victory. With every drop of effort, stress melts away. I savor the ache in my muscles as a sign of progress. 
       Each session is a journey of self-improvement, a canvas of determination. Through the highs and lows, one thing remains constant – the joy of the journey, 
       the exhilaration of becoming stronger, both inside and out. </p>
